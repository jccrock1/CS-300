Analysis and Design - SNHU

## Reflection
* ## What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
### Our problems within this course had to do with making data more accessible to users in a more organized and timely manner.
* ## How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
### I approached each problem by understanding what was being functionally asked of me, as well as the differences between each of three structure types we learned about. 
* ## How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
### My experience with C++ is still only limited, so I read up on information about this language as well as implementing the varying function types that were asked of us. 
* ## How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
### Before this course, I wasn't quite familiar with data structures or how they were applied within specific programming. However, with what I've learned from this course, I am feeling more confident in the advantages and disadvantages, as well as differences, between the three we learned about.
* ## How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
### This course has assisted me in how I will organize and prioritize future projects. Helping me write code that is easier to understand, as well as more adaptable, is key, and using data strucutres will help me keep my code modular.
